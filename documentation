This folder contains the following test scripts

* test_self_quadrature_quads_fmm3dbie: build quadrature for self based on splitting
* axissym_chunkie_const: generating the data for axissymmetric data 
                         on the disk
* test_jacpts_open_surface: test how well jacobi quadrature works for 
                            integrating 1/sqrt(d)
* test_open_surface_solver: open surface solver using fmm3dbie. 
                            DOES NOT WORK due to incorrect quadrature
* helm_open_surface_example: debugging code for figuring out why 
                             test_open_surface_solver did not work
